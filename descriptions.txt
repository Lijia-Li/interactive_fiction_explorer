You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully.
At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit in the rock. Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt. Set into the dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete. A dry streambed leads into the depression. The grate is locked.
It is a small bedroom with a faded carpet and old wallpaper. There is a washbasin, a chair with a tatty dressing gown slung over it, and a window with the curtains drawn. Near the exit leading south is a phone.
There is a flathead screwdriver here.
There is a toothbrush here.
Astoundingly, a bulldozer pokes through your wall. However, you have no time for surprise because the ceiling is collapsing on you as your home is unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new bypass. You are seriously injured in the process, but on your way to the hospital a fleet of Vogon Constructor ships unexpectedly arrives and demolishes the Earth to make way for a new hyperspace bypass.
You are walking down a path through a forest. An endless orchestra of whispering trees and chirping birds play around you. The sun had already dipped below the mountains and the night rolls over the sky.
You are a hunter. The townsfolk tell of a beast that roams the woods at night. Perhaps you could hunt it.
You stop at an intersection of forked pathways. The path on the right winds up a hill. The path on the left curves down to where a lake lies.
The path takes you along the side of a lake. The lake's inky waters shimmer in the moonlight. Fireflies dance among the shrubs.
The path takes you up a hill, a little higher than most of the treetops. The moon casts its pale light around you. You can see a column of smoke nearby. At its base, you see the faint flicker of a campfire.
You continue walking along the side of the lake. The water is calm. A chorus of crickets chime in with the beats of your footsteps. An owl hoots from somewhere in the dark trees.
Suddenly, you hear something speed through the nearby bushes. You instinctively ready your bow and arrow. You hear it again. It sounds like its coming towards you.
You walk towards the fire. The trees around you sway gently in the breeze. The moon watches over you like a pale guardian. An owl glides above you in a silent flight.
Suddenly, you hear something speed through the nearby bushes. You instinctively ready your bow and arrow. You hear it again. It sounds like its coming towards you.
This is an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door. There is a small mailbox here.
This is a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  One particularly large tree with some low branches stands here.
This is a forest, with trees in all directions around you.
You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its south wall.  From here there is a marvelous view of the Canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs still appear to loom far above.  Following the Canyon upstream (north and northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. Fortunately, my vision is better than average and I can discern the top of the Flood Control Dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west and south. There is a pile of leaves on the ground.
You are facing the north side of a white house.  There is no door here, and all the windows are barred.
The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.
As you take your last breath, you feel relieved of your burdens. The feeling passes as you find yourself before the gates of Hell, where the spirits jeer at you and deny you entry. Your senses are disturbed. The objects in the dungeon appear indistinct, bleached of color, even unreal.
This is the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.
The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any attempt by robbers to remove it.
You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.
here is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg. It seems to have recently had a bad experience. The mountings for its jewel-like eyes are empty, and its silver beak is crumpled. Through a cracked crystal window below its left wing you can see the remains of intricate machinery. It is not clear what result winding it would have, as the mainspring appears sprung.
This is a large forest, with trees obstructing all views except to the east, where a small clearing may be seen through the trees.
You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be seen. The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits. A narrow passage goes west. The path you are on continues to the north and south.
